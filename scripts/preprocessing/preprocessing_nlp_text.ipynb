       "0  this is amazing! thank you for putting it together!\\n\\nhonestly i’ve tried so many brands: keyword, keyword, keyword, keyword, keyword etc and the ones i always come back to are old navy. they are so comfortable and wash well and very affordable. \\n\\nthe old navy compression leggings retain their compression even with multiple washes. i also like the yoga leggings which are less compressive but still have a bit of compression. those are a little softer than the compressive ones but i love both. i tried a bunch of fancier brands and ended up just going back to old navy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1  thanks for taking all these pictures, it’s super helpful! i agree that keyword quality has been subpar compared to what i remember in the past. i’m also in your general size range (5’9, 170ish) and i really like [aybl leggings](https://www.beaybl.com/collections/leggings) for a more “pillowy” feeling fabric, medium compression and the high waist actually stays up. good to know on the ov ones, i’ve been eyeing them but i have the same problem with most leggings rolling/sliding down from my waist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "3  this is super interesting! i used to be a die-hard keyword fan (high rise chatarunga) but recently, i've been leaning towards my keywords. aligns are amazing and probably the most comfortable leggings i've ever tried but in my experience, they pill super easily. wunder unders hold up much better for everyday use. \\n\\nedit: also wanted to say that when i was being cheap, i got a few pairs of 90 degree by reflex leggings which are surprisingly decent for being ~$20. they have the compression i like from lulu but can be see through if you have some junk in the trunk or are actually working out and can also cause camel toe. i was also very surprised by the quality of my gym shark leggings, i love how their long length is actually super long (i’m 5’8) and i feel like they hit the mark 100% in terms of trendy gym wear.   \n",
       "4  i've slowly reached the conclusion that keyword align 25\" are my go to forever and i should stop wasting time and money on others. i'm 5'9\", in the ballpark of 175, and a powerlifter, and frankly i can't find any other leggings that accommodate huge legs and ass and tighter waist without falling down constantly lol. the wunder under have a seam that lands basically in the middle of my butt??\\n\\ni also don't love a ton of compression. fleo bounce leggings are okay but ride down somewhat. any of their other fabrics have too much \"squeeze\" for me. same for keyword, lulu fast and frees, and keyword.\\n\\nalso thank you for investing the time to do all angles!! that takes work.                                                                                                                                                    \n",
